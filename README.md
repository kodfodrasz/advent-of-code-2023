What is this? My solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenge in year 2023.
If you would like to know more about it, you can read about it here: <https://adventofcode.com/>

## It is that time of the year again...

... maybe this year I'll be patient enough to solve all the puzzles.

## Previous years

## TODO

There are lots of stuff missing from the library used to solve the puzzles.

### Missing algorithms from the library

#### Handy comparision combinators

 - Between (inclusive, exclusive, upper/lower inclusive)

#### String operations

Edit Distances:

 - Hamming distance (same length)
 - Lewenstein distance (any length)

#### Graph algorithms

Shortest path

 - Dijkstra
 - Floyd-Warschal
 - Bellman-Ford (shortest path, generates all paths from one node as a byproduct)

Circle detection

 - Floyd

Topological Sorting

 - Kahn's algorithm

#### Lists

 - Shuffle

#### Sets

 - Power set
 - Cartesian product[^1]
 - Cartesian product of single set on itself, except diagonal (Does this have a fancy name?)
 - Cartesian product single set on itself, only top triangular matrix, except diagonal (Does this have a fancy name?)

#### Number Theory

 - Largest Common Denominator
 - Least Common Multiple
 - Prime factorization
 - Prime sequence generation
 - Primality test
 - Coprimality test

#### Combinatorics

 - K-Combination
 - Power set
 - Binomial

#### Optimization

 - Hungarian method
 - Backtracking
