What is this? My solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenge in year 2023.
If you would like to know more about it, you can read about it here: <https://adventofcode.com/>

## It is that time of the year again...

... maybe this year I'll be patient enough to solve all the puzzles.

## Previous years

 - https://gitlab.com/kodfodrasz/advent-of-code-2018
 - https://gitlab.com/kodfodrasz/advent-of-code-2020
 - https://github.com/kodfodrasz/advent-of-code-2022

## How to run it?

### Compile it yourself

1. ensure you have at least [.Net SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed
2. clone the repository
3. change directory to the cloned repository root
2. set two environment variables:
  - `AOC_DATA_DIR` to a directory path where the downloaded puzzle inputs will be cached.
  - `AOC_SESSION_COOKIE` is needed to download the puzzle inputs if not found in the cache. You can get it from your browser using web inspector after logging in to the AoC site.
3. `dotnet run -c Release --project .\Kodfodrasz.AoC.Cli\Kodfodrasz.AoC.Cli.fsproj`

### Run a precompiled version

TODO: create a CI build.

#### Compile a single file binary

This mostly a note to self at the moment

1. ensure you have at least [.Net SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed
2. clone the repository
3. change directory to the cloned repository root
4. build a single file binary

    ```powershell
    # This example is for powershell
    # You may need to change the platform identifier [RID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/rid-graph). 
    $target_rid="win-x64"
    dotnet publish -c Release `
      -f net8.0 -r $target_rid `
      --self-contained true `
      -p:PublishSingleFile=true `
      -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true `
      -p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=yes `
      .\Kodfodrasz.AoC.Cli\Kodfodrasz.AoC.Cli.fsproj

    $result_dir="Kodfodrasz.AoC.Cli\bin\Release\net8.0\$target_rid\publish\"
    echo "The binary is in $result_dir" 
    ```
5. You can now run the binary on another computer, and it doesn't need to have the relevant .Net Runtime/SDK installed!
   The environment variables `AOC_DATA_DIR` and `AOC_SESSION_COOKIE` mentioned above will still needed to be set up on the target machine

## TODO

There are lots of stuff missing from the library used to solve the puzzles.

### Missing algorithms from the library

#### Handy comparison combinators

 [ ] Between (inclusive, exclusive, upper/lower inclusive)

#### String operations

Edit Distances:

 [ ] Hamming distance (same length)
 [ ] Lewenstein distance (any length)

#### Graph algorithms

Shortest path

 [ ] Dijkstra
 [ ] Floyd-Warschal
 [ ] Bellman-Ford (shortest path, generates all paths from one node as a byproduct)

Circle detection

 [ ] Floyd

Topological Sorting

 [ ] Kahn's algorithm

#### Lists

 [x] Shuffle

#### Sets

 [ ] Power set
 [ ] Cartesian product[^1]
 [ ] Cartesian product of single set on itself, except diagonal (Does this have a fancy name?)
 [ ] Cartesian product single set on itself, only top triangular matrix, except diagonal (Does this have a fancy name?)

#### Number Theory

 [x] Largest Common Denominator
 [x] Least Common Multiple
 [ ] Prime factorization
 [ ] Prime sequence generation
 [ ] Primality test
 [ ] Coprimality test

#### Combinatorics

 [ ] K-Combination
 [ ] Power set
 [ ] Binomial

#### Optimization

 [ ] Hungarian method
 [ ] Backtracking
